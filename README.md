Title:
📊 Insurance Data Dashboard | Power BI Project 🚀

Post Content:

I recently created an Insurance Data Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize key insights about policies, claims, customer demographics, and revenue trends.

🔹 Project Highlights:

📥 Data Source: Imported data from Microsoft SQL Server

🔄 Data Modeling: Cleaned & transformed data for better insights

🎛️ Slicers & Text Cards: Added interactive slicers and informative text visuals

👥 Multi-row Cards: Displayed gender-based KPIs → Male vs Female Candidates (Total Policies, Total Claims, Total Revenue)

📈 Ribbon Chart: Showed ranking of policies over different time periods

📊 Bar & Line Combo Chart: Compared monthly claims vs. premium collections

🍩 Donut Charts: Visualized policy categories & customer segmentation

🧩 Matrix Visual: Summarized claims and revenue by region & gender

🔍 Drill-Through Feature: Enabled detailed policy-level analysis for deeper insights

This project helped me improve my skills in Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling, SQL, and Interactive Dashboard Design.

💡 I’d love to hear your feedback on the dashboard!
If you are hiring for Data Analyst / Power BI roles, I’d be happy to connect and showcase more of my work. 🚀
